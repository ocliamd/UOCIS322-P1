# UOCIS322 Project 1 - Page Server

Description:   

  A trivial web server in Python.

  Based largely on https://docs.python.org/3.4/howto/sockets.html
  This trivial implementation is not robust:  We have omitted decent
  error handling and many other things to keep the illustration as simple
  as possible.

  Currently this program serves files if they end with .html or .css, and are
  located in ./pages  (where '.' is the directory from which this
  program is run).
